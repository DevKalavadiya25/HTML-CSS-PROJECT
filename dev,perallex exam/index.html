        <p>The word jungle originates from the Sanskrit word jaṅgala (जङ्गल), meaning rough and arid. It came into the
            English language in the 18th century via the Hindustani word for forest (Urdu/Hindi: جنگل / जङ्गल)
            (Jangal).[1][2] Jāṅgala has also been variously transcribed in English as jangal, jangla, jungal, and
            juṅgala.[citation needed] It has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation
            as a dense "tangled thicket".[3][4] The term is prevalent in many languages of the Indian subcontinent, and
            the Iranian Plateau, where it is commonly used to refer to the plant growth replacing primeval forest or to
            the unkempt tropical vegetation that takes over abandoned areas.[5]</p>

            the jungle book (1894) is a collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling. Most of the
            characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear, though a principal character is the
            boy or "man-cub" Mowgli, who is raised in the jungle by wolves. Most stories are set in a forest in India;
            one place mentioned repeatedly is "Seeonee" (Seoni), in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.

            A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of Mowgli, echoing Kipling's
            own childhood. The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White
            Seal over their enemies, as well as Mowgli's. Another important theme is of law and freedom; the stories are
            not about animal behaviour,
            still less about the Darwinian struggle for survive, but about human archetypes in animal form. They teach
            respect for authority, obedience, and knowing one's place in society with "the law of the jungle", but the
            stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds, such as when Mowgli moves between the
            jungle and the village. Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories,
            reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature.

            Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions,
            animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce
            sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a
            clade, meaning they arose from a single common ancestor.

            Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1.05 million are insects, over
            85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77
            million animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They
            have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.
            The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviors is known as ethology.
